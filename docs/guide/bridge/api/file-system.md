# File System Module

The File System (shortend Fs) module provides secure and isolated access to the file system. It enables applications to interact with files and directories within predefined scopes, ensuring data integrity and sandboxing from the global file system.

## Overview

The module is organized into several main scopes, each serving a specific purpose:

- **cache**: Temporary storage that should always be used for cached data that can be purged without loss of critical information.
- **data**: Persistent storage for application data and files.
- **trash**: A recycle bin area where deleted files are temporarily held before permanent removal.
- **diagnostics**: Access to diagnostic files and logs for troubleshooting and monitoring.

These scopes help maintain data organization, security, and lifecycle management within the Desktopr environment and can't be changed.

## Methods

## Example Usage

```ts
// Writing a text file to the data (persistent) scope
await Desktopr.fs.data.writeText('notes/todo.txt', 'Remember to review the documentation.');

// Reading the text file back
const content = await Desktopr.fs.data.readText('notes/todo.txt');
console.log(content); // Output: Remember to review the documentation.
```

## Notes

:::tip
The `cache` namespace is intended for temporary files that can be cleared without affecting user data, while the `data` namespace is for persistent files that should be preserved across sessions and backups.
:::

:::warning
Access through the File System module is strictly limited to the Desktopr isolated environment. It does not provide access to the global file system of the host machine, ensuring security and sandboxing.
