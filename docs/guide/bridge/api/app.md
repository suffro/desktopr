# App Module

The `app` module of the Desktopr bridge provides methods to retrieve system-level information and control the main application. Use this module when you need to access details about the app environment or programmatically exit the application.

## Overview

The `app` interface is responsible for:

- Fetching general information about the running Desktopr application and its environment.
- Allowing programmatic exit of the app (with appropriate permissions).

These features are useful for diagnostics, analytics, and scenarios where the app needs to be closed from code (e.g., after a critical error or on user request).

## Methods

| Method         | Description                                                        | Return Type    |
|--------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `info()`       | Retrieves detailed information about the Desktopr app instance, including version, platform, and environment. | `Promise<AppInfo>` |
| `exit()`       | Closes the Desktopr application. Requires sufficient permissions and may not be available in all contexts. | `Promise<void>`    |

## AppInfo structure

The `AppInfo` object returned by `info()` contains the following fields:

| Field           | Type               | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `arch`          | string             | The system architecture (e.g., `x64`, `arm64`).                                                |
| `current_dir`   | string             | The current working directory of the app process.                                              |
| `exec_dir`      | string             | The directory where the app executable is located.                                             |
| `exec_path`     | string             | The full path to the app executable file.                                                      |
| `has_main_window` | boolean           | Indicates whether the app currently has a main window open.                                    |
| `is_debug`      | boolean            | Indicates if the app is running in debug mode.                                                 |
| `name`          | string             | The display name of the application.                                                           |
| `now_unix_ms`   | number             | The current timestamp in milliseconds since Unix epoch.                                        |
| `os`            | string             | The operating system platform (e.g., `win32`, `darwin`).                                       |
| `pid`           | number             | The process ID of the running app instance.                                                    |
| `primary_screen`| `AppScreenInfo`    | Information about the primary display screen.                                                  |
| `screens`       | `AppScreenInfo[]`  | Array of information objects for all connected display screens.                                |
| `temp_dir`      | string             | The path to the temporary directory used by the app.                                          |
| `version`       | string             | The version of the Desktopr app.                                                            |
| `windows`       | `AppWindowInfo[]`  | Array of information objects for all open app windows.                                        |

## Example Usage

```js
// Retrieve app information
const info = await Desktopr.app.info();
console.log('Platform:', info.os);
```

## Notes

:::tip Efficient usage of `info()`
Cache the result of `info()` if you need app details multiple times, as the information is static for the session and repeated calls may be unnecessary.
:::

:::warning
The `exit()` method will immediately terminate the Desktopr app if permissions allow. Use this method with caution and always ensure the user is notified or has saved their work.
